# Spelling quiz
Flag: picoCTF{perhaps_the_dog_jumped_over_was_just_tired}

After looking at the source code, it implied that it encrypted both the files `study-guide.txt` and `flag.txt` were encrypted by a substitution cipher, with a random key.
With the help of the website `https://quipqiup.com/`, I decrypted the `flag.txt` file to obtain the flag.
